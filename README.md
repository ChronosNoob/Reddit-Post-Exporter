# Reddit-Post-Exporter
This repository would export posts and their top comments in picture/document format. However, due to API limitations export speeds are severely limited for the bodytext of submissions. This code will only be able to export one post per second at best, excluding post-processing to make the exported image/doc.

Please refer to https://github.com/ChronosNoob/Reddit-Media-Downloader for a fast, media only version.
